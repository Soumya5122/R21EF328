# Implementation
1) You need to install Express and axios .
2) And install npm install
3) I was not able to upload node modules but asw in screenshoot 1 as you install npm the node modules will be installed.
4) after installing get your port number using echo $PORT
5) and then run  npm run start it will setup
6) then run command node server.js
7) then open postman and using get method get the response(2,3,4 screenshoots are response output)
